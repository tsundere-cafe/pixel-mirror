<tr><td>2005/10/14<br><img src="img/051014.png"  ></td><td>I thought maybe if I shrank the screen size<br>I wouldn't have to draw as much and the<br>game would get done faster.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/10/16<br><img src="img/051016.png"  ></td><td>Now the ship can shoot.<br>This is probably the most fun stage<br>of game development...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/08<br><img src="img/051108.png"  ></td><td>Made a map editor and added map display.<br>It works just as I told it to,<br>yet I can't suppress an admiring "Oooh!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/16<br><img src="img/051116.png"  ></td><td>Tried making an enemy character,<br>though it doesn't do anything yet.<br>This one is stuck to the map, in contrast<br>to the player, who is part of the screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/17<br><img src="img/051117.png"  ></td><td>Made it so you can blow up the<br>enemy character with a beam.<br>Simple destruction animation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/18<br><img src="img/051118.png"  ></td><td>Allowed display of onscreen messages.<br>A single line in the middle of the screen...<br>Not all that useful.<br>This is when I drew the font.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/20<br><img src="img/051120.png"  ></td><td>Got points to show in the upper-left.<br>Upper-right is the refresh rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/23<br><img src="img/051123.png"  ></td><td>Made clouds appear at random in the<br>background and added a boost effect to<br>the ship.  I wanted to add a sense of speed.<br>The colors look like a Game Boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/24<br><img src="img/051124.png"  ></td><td>Added a spinning enemy.<br>This is the one you see right at the<br>beginning of the final version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/25<br><img src="img/051125.png"  ></td><td>Changed and balanced the background colors.<br>I originally planned to do the whole thing<br>in two colors, but there's no going<br>back now...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/26<br><img src="img/051126.png"  ></td><td>Game Over display.<br>In other words, added damage detection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/27<br><img src="img/051127.png"  ></td><td>Made a speed-up item.<br>Also added the twin beam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/28<br><img src="img/051128_1.png"></td><td>Made an enemy that attacks from behind.<br>Guxt features a lot of enemies that come from<br>behind.  This one was actually left over from an<br>abandoned game I once worked on with BA2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/28<br><img src="img/051128_2.png"></td><td>An enemy that circles around the player.<br>The drawing rate makes fast enemies<br>look too blurry...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/11/29<br><img src="img/051129.png"  ></td><td>Tried making an enemy that shoots back.<br>These appear from the bottom.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/01<br><img src="img/051201.png"  ></td><td>Started work on the Stage 1 boss.<br>It's made out of seven characters:<br>wings, eye, and gun turrets.<br>I don't have the energy to make<br>multijointed characters...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/02<br><img src="img/051202_1.png"></td><td>Made it so the Stage 1 boss<br>appears from behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/02<br><img src="img/051202_2.png"></td><td>Gave the boss a three-way laser.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/02<br><img src="img/051202_3.png"></td><td>Made it so that item pickup points<br>change depending on the timing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/04<br><img src="img/051204.png"  ></td><td>Made a death scene for the Stage 1 boss.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/07<br><img src="img/051207_1.png"></td><td>Made the entry ranking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/07<br><img src="img/051207_2.png"></td><td>Made the ranking screen.<br>It wasn't until the game was nearly<br>finished that I connected it to the<br>title screen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/08<br><img src="img/051208_1.png"></td><td>And with a typical boost scene,<br>Stage 1 is finished.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/12<br><img src="img/051212.png"  ></td><td>An abandoned character.<br>Originally it was supposed to appear<br>throughout the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/14<br><img src="img/051214.png"  ></td><td>Started work on Stage 2.<br>It took two months already to get this far...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/15<br><img src="img/051215_1.png"></td><td>Stage 2 is all about the asteroids.<br>You can dodge or shoot them down.<br>They're tough, so dodging is best...<br>Three-way beam.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/15<br><img src="img/051215_2.png"></td><td>A different three-way beam.<br>And yet another new enemy that comes from<br>behind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2005/12/20<br><img src="img/051220.png"  ></td><td>One-hit death was getting too strict,<br>so I added a shield item.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/01/18<br><img src="img/060118.png"  ></td><td>The tiny screen makes even large enemies<br>easy to draw.  Looks like I made the right<br>decision...  The fish missiles kept coming<br>back from offscreen, which wasn't fair,<br>so they were scrapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/01/21<br><img src="img/060121.png"  ></td><td>Missiles that break into three at the<br>edge of the screen.  I got the balance<br>worked out, but something about them just<br>isn't that cool.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/01/23<br><img src="img/060123.png"  ></td><td>Made the title screen.<br>No title decided yet, though.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/01/27<br><img src="img/060127.png"  ></td><td>The key configuration screen.<br>This is the first time I've ever<br>seriously made one of these...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/02<br><img src="img/060202.png"  ></td><td>Built map hit detection for Stage 3.<br>I always struggle with this part...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/03<br><img src="img/060203.png"  ></td><td>If you hit the walls, it's instant<br>death, so that's not that hard, but...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/04<br><img src="img/060204.png"  ></td><td>The bullet/map detection is harder,<br>because the bullets move faster<br>and tend to slip through the walls...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/11<br><img src="img/060211.png"  ></td><td>The difficulty's ending up high,<br>but since I'm not very good at shooters,<br>I figure if I can beat the game<br>maybe the difficulty's just right...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/13<br><img src="img/060213.png"  ></td><td>Enemy rush right at the beginning of Stage 3.<br>I thought maybe I needed to up the tempo<br>a bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/20<br><img src="img/060220.png"  ></td><td>You can actually hit the wall without<br>getting hurt.  Maybe some players never noticed.<br>A parallel three-shot beam that got scrapped.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/02/22<br><img src="img/060222.png"  ></td><td>Added breakable walls.<br>They only showed up here in the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/03/01<br><img src="img/060301.png"  ></td><td>An enemy that comes from the front<br>and swoops around to the back.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/03/03<br><img src="img/060303_1.png"></td><td>Secret character!<br>It's fun to add secret bonuses,<br>but I wish they hadn't taken so much time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/03/03<br><img src="img/060303_2.png"></td><td>Redrew the clouds and added larger ones.<br>If I make the ones in front move faster,<br>you start to feel the speed... is the idea.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/03/12<br><img src="img/060312.png"  ></td><td>What was this screenshot again...<br>Just coordinates display?</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/03/21<br><img src="img/060321.png"  ></td><td>Started the Stage 3 boss.<br>Just "Think it, add it," over and over again.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/04/01<br><img src="img/060401.png"  ></td><td>I think I kind of mechanically gave it<br>three levels of attack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/05/07<br><img src="img/060507.png"  ></td><td>I figured three shields would make it<br>too easy not to die, so I weakened it to the<br>form of a power-up.  It looks fancy,<br>so I don't expect that many complaints...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/05/24<br><img src="img/060524.png"  ></td><td>I've only got two screenshots of Stage 4...<br>I guess I wanted to finish the whole thing<br>up as soon as possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2006/12/11<br><img src="img/061211.png"  ></td><td>Stage 5's fast-scrolling scene.<br>Actually, it's not the background that's moving<br>fast, just the rocks...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/06<br><img src="img/070106.png"  ></td><td>The Stage 5 opening.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/09<br><img src="img/070109.png"  ></td><td>I always liked the feeling of blowing up<br>ground targets in Hudson's shooters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/14<br><img src="img/070114.png"  ></td><td>I've sure got a lot of screens of Stage 5...<br>With completion near, the tension was high,<br>I guess.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/23<br><img src="img/070123.png"  ></td><td>Just before the final boss.<br>I think now it was a mistake to change to<br>the boss music and not bring the boss out<br>right away.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/27<br><img src="img/070127.png"  ></td><td>An uncluttered-looking boss appears.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/01/30<br><img src="img/070130.png"  ></td><td>The lids close on the weak spots.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/02/05<br><img src="img/070205.png"  ></td><td>The large bullets send the player dodging<br>left and right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/02/18<br><img src="img/070218.png"  ></td><td>I settled on "Guxt" for the title.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/02/22<br><img src="img/070222.png"  ></td><td>Made the Boss 5 death scene.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/02/24<br><img src="img/070224.png"  ></td><td>Added selection of Trial and Ranking modes.<br>The border on the font was getting to be<br>a pain, so I ditched it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/03/06<br><img src="img/070306.png"  ></td><td>Made the enemy shots easier to spot.<br>My plan was to stick with greyscale, but...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/04/11<br><img src="img/070411.png"  ></td><td>The final boss of the Trial stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/04/18<br><img src="img/070418.png"  ></td><td>The more I redrew it, the more it looked<br>like Fuyuhiko.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/04/19<br><img src="img/070419.png"  ></td><td>I gather players didn't find it too hard...<br>Still, you can at least enjoy the tension<br>of meeting it for the first time...</td></tr>
<tr><td>2007/04/21<br><img src="img/070421.png"  ></td><td>Almost done.</td></tr>
